# MineSweeper
MineSweeper Game and Solver. \\
 I recently learned how to play MineSweeper, and got stuck on a table that is 999x999. Since I kept making mistakes I recreated the game and the created a solver. Notice that the solver doesn't see the solution (that would be cheating) and only calculates the possible moves, in fact, sometimes there are no possible moves.
